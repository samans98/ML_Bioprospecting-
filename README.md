This project aims to guide bioprospecting (i.e. the exploration of natural sources for items that can be developed into commercially valuable products) using ML/DL strategies.

The origins of a biological entity can by described by examining its evolutionary pressures.
Phenotypic traits are the result of the these pressures.
Modeling evolutionary pressures could assist in predicting novel instances of a phenotypic trait. 

Humans have an impressive track record of obtianing utility from natural objects.
Utility is an abstract definition that can include: food, medicine, dyes, textiles, structures, decoration/art, etc. 
  
To better clarify, here is an example: Chances are, you are making use of caffeine throughout your days. Caffeine is a natural stimulat. 
There are many different forms of natural stimulants. However, they do not all work they same - there are various pharmacological mechanisms in which an object can have stimulating effects.
To summarize, 'Stimulant' is the pheontypic trait which can be manifested through different mechanisms. Evolution selects for the trait, not the mechanism- the mechanism is dictated by the biological state present when the pressures are applied. =
With a target utility in mind, a systemic investigation can be devised to discover additional instances of said utility.
